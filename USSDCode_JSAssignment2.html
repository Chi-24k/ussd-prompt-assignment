<!-- 04:25...17.08.2023...will continue this later. There are many other functionalities I'd love to add like strict adherence to data types like numbers and strings. And many more conditional statements containing funny msgs and number of tries too, but that'd all be a bit later. Idk why the 'typeof' I did started messing up. It was working very well earlier...phew, this is fun.



...*this was within transferOptions 1 just before the second alert, I hope I understand later on lol.
 User doesn't insert number input...no options for extra tries too lol. Will add better functionalities later like minimum transfer deposit and some praises for our agbas that transfer plenty schmoney
            
if(transferDeposit !== typeof(Number)){
 alert("You are a part of this country's problems...")
 } -->
